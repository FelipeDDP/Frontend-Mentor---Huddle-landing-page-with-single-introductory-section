### What I learned

This is my first individual project combining the use o CSS Grid and Flexbox, and as such I am pretty happy with the final result regarding its responsiveness. I tried to use as few redundant grid lines as possible, applied media queries for different screen sizes and refactored the code a few times to make it cleaner. 

For my next project, I would like to structure the page in a more solid and automatically responsive grid outline so as to avoid the use of media queries as much as possible. One of the main inspirations for this goal is this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVQiNpqXov8) by Jen Simmons from Layout Land, where they demonstrate the notion of smartly applying grid to give the page an innate squishiness.
